> My vocational software development experience is spotty, but I have

> developing my own gift registry web application and learning
> Haskell-and by pursuing a masters in computer science through
> Stanford's SCPD program. I do not plan to ever stop learning and
> experimenting with new technologies, and the web is the place to do

> or integrating that new mail protocol we've all been waiting for
> (and you know we need one but Wave hasn't taken off).
