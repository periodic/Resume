\opening{To whom it may concern:}

I've spent the last five years working on the web and supporting people online.  Now I want to change pace and build the infrastructure that makes the web a better place for work and play.  I want to build things that have an impact on millions instead of just hundreds.  CyberSource is a perfect place for me to do that as one of the leading payment gateways.

My experience so far has been largely with system administration and web development, but I want to move to a fully development-focused career where I can spend more time buried in the code I love.  I've been spending the last five years learning different technologies--from C to Haskell and from ZFS to CouchDB--and am now half-way to an MS in computer science at Stanford.  My background is broad, and I learn quickly.

My strong learning drive, quick adaptation, and personal initiative would make me an great employee for CyberSource.  I am eager to work as part of a team building top-quality software and services.  I urge you to consider me for your open engineering and development positions.  I look forward to working starting new projects soon.


\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
